## Version 3 of the Wall of Fame Web App

### Purpose of the app

* Record top scores by skaters of specific skating club (Calalta FSC to start)
* Record medalists
* Record award winners
* Record National Team Members
* Record Olympic Team Members

### Why am I doing this

I am doing this to further my coding ability, to learn new things, and to provide a tool for skating clubs to reconize their athletes

### Why is this v3?

I started this project a number of years ago as a Ruby on Rails experiment. I had it mostly working, but it wasn't how I wanted it.

I tried again with Ruby on Rails as a back end and Angular as a front end to try to learn about micro services. I needed more time with Angular before I should have attempted this.

I am restarting the project in Ruby on Rails. Once I have the project completed I will revisit splitting it into smaller chunks in a microservice style approach
